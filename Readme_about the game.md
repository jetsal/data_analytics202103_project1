# Repository of HANGMAN by Jet

Welcome to my repository of the game hangman!

This repository contains the code to the game hangman, as made for my first Ironhack data-analysis project (March 2021).

## Rules of the game
The game starts with the computer choosing a random word from a predefined list. 
The player has to guess the word, letter by letter. 

When the player guesses a letter that is not in the list, the next step in the preparation of the hanging is performed.

The game ends when the player guessed either too many wrong letters (player looses), or the word is guessed completely (player wins).

## Trello
There is a Trello-board for this the game: https://trello.com/b/7DS0vwoP/hangman-by-jet
