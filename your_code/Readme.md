# Repository of HANGMAN BY JET

Welcome to my repository of the game hangman!

This repository contains the code to the game hangman, as made for my first Ironhack data-analysis project (March 2021).

## Rules of the game
The game starts with the computer choosing a random word from a predefined list. 
Now the player has to guess the word, letter by letter. The game ends when there are too many letters chosen that are not in the chosen word (player looses), or is the word is guessed completely (player wins).

For each guessed letter that is not in the list, the next step in the preparation of the hanging is performed. 
After eleven wrong guesses, the game is over: you are hanged.
